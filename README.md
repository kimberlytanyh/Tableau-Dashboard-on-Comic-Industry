# Tableau-Dashboard-on-Comic-Industry

Using comic superhero data we obtained from Kaggle, our group discovered interesting overlaps in cultural trends and comic superhero creation through data exploration in Tableau.
We have created an interactive dashboard illustrating our findings on gender stratification in the comic book industry. Feel free to download our project file to check it out.

Attached: Project Tableau file and original (uncleaned) dataset from Kaggle.

Please refrain from using our work as your own for homework submission.
